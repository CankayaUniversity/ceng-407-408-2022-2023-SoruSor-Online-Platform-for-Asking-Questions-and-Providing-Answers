SoruSor: Online Platform for Asking Questions and Providing Answers
The demand for precise and effective question-answering systems has substantially increased in the modern world as online venues for asking and answering questions have risen in popularity.
Dealing with inappropriate and objectionable information that violates user standards and community standards is one of the biggest issues in establishing such systems. This problem can be solved with the use of insult censor AI technology, which works by automatically identifying and removing offensive words.


The objective of this project is to create an artificial intelligence (AI) system that can instantly recognize and delete insults and other types of offensive content from question-and-answer forums akin to websites like Quora. The system will examine user-generated material and identify any instances of abusive language or improper conduct using cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Additionally, the system will be able to pick up on new abusive linguistic patterns and adjust, which will help it become more efficient over time.


The project will entail creating and implementing an AI model for censorship utilizing machine learning techniques like deep learning and neural networks. In order to identify patterns and characteristics that are indicative of abusive language, the model will be trained using a sizable sample of annotated text data. To increase the precision and efficacy of the AI model, the system will also include user input and human moderation.


The end goal of this project is to develop an effective and trustworthy insult censor AI system that can support the development of a polite and secure online community for users of question-and-answer forums. The system will give administrators and moderators a useful tool for controlling and maintaining online material, and it will support the creation of a welcoming atmosphere for all users.
